# Camel Dashboard

## Introduction

To allow easy manipulations of CAM experiments through the API, we developped a dashboard handling the basic administration operations.

## Configuration

To properly run, a .env file is needed with the following information:

```
DEV_URL=
```

where the DEV_URL is the link to the API.

## Run

To start the server locally, ru the following command in a terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
